### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Matt!

I'm a web developer at [Aptuitiv](https://www.aptuitiv.com) building custom websites and web applications with modern web technologies. Beyond my work at Aptuitiv I have been hacking on things and programming since age 13. My primary passion when it comes to development is building graphical applications for desktop and the web. My favorite languages at the moment are Rust, C++, and Javascript. I'm currently working on a GameBoy (DMG-01) emulator with a friend written in C++ called [EmuBoy](https://github.com/matthewgallant/EmuBoy).
