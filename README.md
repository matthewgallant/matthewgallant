### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Matt!

I'm a web developer at a company called Aptuitiv building amazing websites with the lastest web technologies. Beyond my experience at Aptuitiv I have been working with web development (both frontend and backend) since I was 13. My primary passion when it comes to development is building graphical applicatons whether it's desktop or for the web. Thanks for checking out my little corner of the internet!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [EmuBoy](https://github.com/matthewgallant/EmuBoy) â€” a WIP GameBoy emulator written in C++.
