# üëã Howdy!

I'm Matt, a front-end developer at [Aptuitiv](https://aptuitiv.com) building custom websites and web applications with modern web technologies. Beyond my work at Aptuitiv I have been hacking on things and programming since I was a young-in. My passion is embedded systems engineering. My favorite languages at the moment are Rust, C++, and Javascript. I'm currently working on a GameBoy (DMG-01) emulator written in Rust/C++ called [EmuBoy](https://github.com/matthewgallant/EmuBoy).

## What I Do For Work

For my day-to-day work I do many tasks beyond whats listed here but these are some highlights:

- Build [pixel-perfect] custom websites (often from designs)
- Interact with clients directly to assess and meet their needs
- Increase developer efficiency by introducing new methodologies

## What I Do In My Free Time

My free time is truly when I get to express what I like as a developer. This facet of my life is so complicated but I can boil it down to at least a few items.

- Systems programming
- Open source ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Desktop and web app development
- Tinkering with Linux (I use Arch BTW)

## Software & Tools

At the end of the day it doesn't really matter what tool you use so long as you can get the job done, right?

- Editors: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Nano
- Shell: ZSH
- Version Control: Git, Tower
- Operating Systems: macOS, Arch Linux
